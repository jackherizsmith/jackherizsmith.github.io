This document has been made with insights from a site called [Make a README](https://www.makeareadme.com/).

## Background

I have built my website using HTML and CSS learnings from [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/), which I started in October this year. There are links at the top of the page to my GitHub repository, as well as FCC and CodeWars profiles, to complete my application to join the Spring cohort of Founders and Coders.

## Footer links

I've also included links at the bottom of the page in case it's of interest - these include a CodePen project I started to practice making a form, and some resources I've collected in the last couple of months which might be interesting.

## Accessibility

For the most part, the contrast of foreground and background is 7.74. The navbar has a contrast of 5.5 which meets most WCAG guidelines, whilst the footer failed with a contrast of 3... So I have corrected the background to the darker palette option.

## Image carousel

The image carousel can be navigated in a number of ways. As before, simply clicking the navigation buttons works, otherwise the user can select which image they want to scroll to by selecting it's corresponding number on the keyboard. The user can also toggle autoplay by pressing the spacebar, or use the left and right cursor to move left or right.

## Further development

My website isn't as responsive as I'd like it to be. Specifically, whilst the video and slideshow work fine on mobile, I'd have liked to work out how to make the mobile site look like the desktop site with the existing media query. There's also a gap between navigable 'sections' - this comes from my 'hidden' element, and I had trouble reducing this blank space without hiding some content under the floating navbar.

As it is, I have left the media query to illustrate how I wanted the mobile site to look.
